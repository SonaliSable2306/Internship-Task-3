# Housing Dataset - Task 3: Linear Regression Modeling

This task involves applying **Linear Regression** to the Housing dataset to predict house prices based on multiple features. The goal is to understand the influence of various predictors and evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics.

## Steps Performed

- Load and preview the dataset
- Display dataset info, data types, and missing values
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Visualize correlation matrix using a heatmap
- Encode categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Scale the features using `StandardScaler`
- Fit a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
